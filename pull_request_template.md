## MVP
- [ ] a grid of squares (cells) that can be in at least 2 states (alive, dead)
- [ ] cells correctly update state based on the rules of Conway's Game of Life
  - _birth_ - a "dead" cell with exactly 3 live neighbors will "come to life"
  - _life_ - a "live" cell with exactly 2 or 3 live neighbors will "stay alive"
  - _death_ - a "live" cell with a single OR 4+ live neighbors will "die"
- [ ] ability to pause, resume, and restart the simulation
- [ ] display that identifies which generation (#) is currently being displayed
- [ ] ability to change the time step to change the speed at which new generations are born
## Stretch
- [ ] allow the user to customize the size of their grid
- [ ] add additional states
- [ ] create some premade starting states with some well-known automata formations
